This "in-world" ad for the film Creative Control was a very interesting early project that I worked on at Sandwich.

It was the second or third project I had worked on at Sandwich as an AE and we were doing cleanup, 3D tracking, roto, and motion graphics on 4k Cinemascope plates.

We had so many issues with tracking that I ended up learned mocha Pro's 3D tracker and PFTrack just to get some of the shots done, and what we couldn't track correctly we just brute-forced with manual tracking.

Check out the trailer for the full film below.
