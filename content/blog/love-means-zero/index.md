Another collaboration between Zach Hobesh, Matthew Wauhkonen, and myself - we did a bunch of small clean-up work on this documentary.

Everything from tweaking scores for the tennis match in b-roll to work with the story being told, to stabilizing long takes, to soft-splits, to roto and back-ground replacement.

We used every trick in the book to add a little more polish to this great documentary.
