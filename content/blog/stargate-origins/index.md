I grew up watching all the different Stargate series and it's actually part of what got me interested in VFX in the first place - so I jumped at the opportunity to have my name in the credits when Tom called saying he could use some help.

I really only did one day's worth of work on this comping in moons, painting out tire-tracks, and some other small things... Plus another day attempting to track a 46 second long shot of sand dunes in [mocha](https://borisfx.com/products/mocha-pro/).
