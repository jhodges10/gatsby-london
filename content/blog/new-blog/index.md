description: "Gatsby, Static sites, and Progressive Web Apps"
---

Last year I launched a new version of my website built in raw HTML with the help of HTML5UP and it was a lot of work building things without templates.

A couple of months after I did that, I learned about Gatsby and fell in love with its component-based React + GraphQL build system that make creating a blog like this as simple as customizing a template, writing some posts, and deploying to Netlify!

The out-of-the-box functionality that Gatsby provides includes SEO and Progressive Web App functionality courtesy of an auto-built service worker that adds the ability to install your website or blog as an application to the home screen of your phone, as well as providing offline functionality.
