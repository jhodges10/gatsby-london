### "OH MY GOD, IT'S INGRID THORBURN"

What happens when Instagram changes their UI between production and post-production?

Well, you hire people who spend most of their time touching up phone screens, doing paint work/ clean-up, and you put them to work fixing the UI.

Matt Wauhkonen, Zach Hobesh, Daniel Corona, and myself spent the majority of our Christmas vacation in 2016 finishing up the VFX on the film before sending it off to Sundance where it was then sold to Magnolia pictures.

Going and seeing my name in the credits in the theater right next to so many other talented individuals made it all worth it though.
