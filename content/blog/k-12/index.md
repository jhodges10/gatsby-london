I had the opportunity to work once again with the team at Frame 48 on another awesome project. This time as the VFX Supervisor on K-12, a film which shot in Budapest over the course of a month and a half, and then through post-production in Los Angeles.

We brought on specialists from around the world to build vegetation, underwater worlds, run simulations, create architectural visualizations, and roto.

We did everything from clean-up to full-cg shots, with a lot of compositing, for a total of 350+ shots.
