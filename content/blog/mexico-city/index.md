The three months I spent in Budapest last fall working on K-12 opened my eyes to the idea of living and working outside of the United States.

I had an opportunity in between leases on apartments and decided to head down to Mexico for a month to split an apartment with a friend of mine, Dan Pierson, the founder of [Bolt Collective](https://joinbolt.com).

Whilst down there I worked remotely on a number of projects:

- Continued development on [Dash Nexus](https://app.dashnexus.org)
- A new software project for [Hodges Badge Company](https://www.hodgesbadge.com) to manage a new Cold Foil Printer
- A data science project through [North Atlantic Tech](https://www.northatlantic.tech) utilizing Python, Docker, AWS, Redis, GraphQL, Hasura, etc.
